# Evaluation


**Step 1: Define Evaluation Metrics**
Establish metrics to evaluate the performance of your retrieval algorithm. Common metrics include:

1. Precision: The fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant.
2. Recall: The fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved.
3. F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
4. Mean Average Precision (MAP): The average of precision scores at different threshold levels.
5. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG): Measures the ranking quality of the retrieved documents.

**Step 2: Prepare the Dataset**
1. Input Papers: Create a list of input papers for which you want to retrieve relevant papers.
2. Ground Truth: Establish a ground truth dataset that includes relevant papers for each input paper. This can be done manually or using expert judgment.

**Step 3: Implement Baseline Algorithms**
Choose traditional retrieval algorithms for comparison, such as:

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
2. BM25 (Best Matching 25)
3. Vector Space Model
4. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

**Step 4: Implement Your Algorithm**
Implement your retrieval algorithm using the data you have (titles, citations, references). Consider combining features such as:

1. Title Similarity: Using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
2. Citation Network: Using graph-based algorithms like PageRank.
3. References Similarity: Similar to citation analysis.

**Step 5: Perform Retrieval**
For each input paper, use both traditional algorithms and your algorithm to retrieve relevant papers.

**Step 6: Evaluate the Results**
1. Relevance Assessment: For each retrieved paper, determine if it is relevant based on the ground truth.
2. Compare Metrics: Compare the precision, recall, F1 score, MAP, and NDCG for each algorithm.

**Step 7: Analyze Findings**
1. Undiscovered Papers: Identify papers that your algorithm retrieves which traditional algorithms do not. Assess their relevance manually.
2. Overall Performance: Compare the overall performance of your algorithm against the traditional algorithms.

**Step 8: Statistical Analysis**
Perform statistical tests to determine if the differences in performance are significant. Common tests include:

1. Paired t-test
2. Wilcoxon signed-rank test
